# Hi there, I'm Pablo üëã

I am a professional transitioning into **backend development with Java**, while also having knowledge of other languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  

Currently, I am specializing in **Java and Spring WebFlux** through ITAcademy at Barcelona Activa, where I am:  
- Developing REST APIs  
- Working with relational databases (MySQL, H2) and non-relational databases (MongoDB)  
- Applying programming best practices such as **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code**
